# Design Patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Builder Pattern** - Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

**Factory Pattern** - Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Prototype Pattern** - Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

**Singleton Pattern** - Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Facade Pattern** - Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

**Adapter Pattern** - Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

**Decorator Pattern** - Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
