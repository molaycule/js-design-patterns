# Design Patterns

### Builder Pattern
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### Factory Pattern
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Prototype Pattern
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### Singleton Pattern
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
